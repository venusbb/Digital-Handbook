The Central Digital and Data Office (CDDO) has published comprehensive accessibility guidance to ensure that public-facing digital services are inclusive and accessible to all users. This guidance is designed to help government agencies and departments meet the accessibility requirements for their websites and applications, making them usable by as many people as possible, including those with disabilities.

By following this guidance, organizations can create digital services that are not only compliant with legal standards but also provide a better user experience for everyone. The guidance covers various aspects of accessibility, including designing accessible services, creating accessible content, and testing with assistive technologies.

The Equality Act 2010 is a comprehensive piece of legislation that legally protects individuals from discrimination in the workplace and wider society. It consolidates previous anti-discrimination laws into a single Act, making it easier to understand and strengthening protection in some areas. The Act covers various forms of discrimination, including those based on age, disability, gender reassignment, race, religion or belief, sex, and sexual orientation. It also imposes a public sector equality duty, requiring public bodies to consider how their policies and practices can reduce socio-economic inequalities.
